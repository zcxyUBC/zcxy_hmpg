## Introduction
Welcome! My name is Zou Chenxuanyin, and I am a PhD student in the Chemical and Biological Engineering Department at University of British Columnbia, Vancouver, BC, CANADA. 

My research interests focus on multiobjective optimization, semi-infinite programming, and optimal control. I am devoted to handling multiobjective optimization problems with inequality path constraints in non-linear dynamic systems. Furthermore, I have a broad knowledge of multiobjective methods. I am currently trying to incorporate parallel and distributed computation into my research to intensify the power of algorithms to solve large-scale and complicated problems and improve efficiency.
