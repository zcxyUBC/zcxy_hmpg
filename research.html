<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>In this article, two algorithms are proposed to solve
    multiobjective path-constrained dynamic optimization problems. In each algorithm, an adaptive ε-constraint method is
    employed to solve the multiobjective dynamic optimization problems (MODOPs) with path constraints in two iterative
    loops. In the outer loop, the adaptive ε -constraint method adaptively adjusts the choice of the parameters ε ,
    which transfers MODOP into a sequence of single-objective dynamic optimization problems (SODOPs) with extra
    inequality constraints. In the inner loop, two different algorithms are used to solve the single-objective
    optimization problems. The first algorithm guarantees that the path constraints can be satisfied with any finite
    prescribed tolerance by replacing path constraints with a finite number of point constraints. Furthermore, the
    second algorithm guarantees that the path constraints are rigorously satisfied by enforcing the path constraints at
    a limited number of time points and by restricting the right-hand side of the path constraints. The proposed
    algorithms are proven to converge within finite iterations. The effectiveness of the algorithms is verified via
    numerical studies, along with a comparison to a state-of-the-art algorithm. </p>

<strong>An alternated direction method for multiobjective optimization problems</strong><br>
Jun Fu; Chenxuanyin Zou<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b> This paper presents a descent-direction-constrained method without a pri- ori parameters (e.g., weighting factors) for locating Pareto optimal solutions of mul- tiobjective optimization problems by iteratively searching descent directions for a fixed objective with consideration to the others and evaluating their step lengths. The descent direction is determined through a quadratic subproblem constrained by the approximations of all but the fixed objective function of the original multiobjective problem. In the nonconvex case, both linear and quadratic approximations are consid- ered with a penalty added to the objective function of the subproblem. In the convex case, a multiobjective subproblem composed of quadratic approximations of original objective functions, a generalization of Newton-type method, is proposed to analyze improvement upon traditional methods. Under certain differentiability assumptions, the algorithm is shown to converge to a point satisfying the proposed first-order nec- essary conditions for Pareto optimality, simultaneously avoiding weakly Pareto solu- tions and superlinearly and quadratically to the Pareto points with further sufficient conditions satisfied under strict convex assumptions. Finally, the numerical tests are conducted to demonstrate superiority and effectiveness of our method. </p><br>
